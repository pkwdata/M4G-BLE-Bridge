# ⚠️ CRITICAL: GitHub Pages Configuration Issue

## The Problem

Your deployment is failing because **GitHub Pages is using Jekyll** (the default static site builder) instead of our **GitHub Actions workflow**.

The error shows:
```
GitHub Pages: github-pages v232
GitHub Pages: jekyll v3.10.0
```

This means Pages is in **"Deploy from a branch"** mode, NOT **"GitHub Actions"** mode.

## The Solution

You must **manually change the Pages source** to GitHub Actions:

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Go to Pages Settings**:
   - Visit: https://github.com/pkwdata/M4G-BLE-Bridge/settings/pages
   
2. **Look for "Build and deployment" section**
   
3. **Change the Source**:
   ```
   Current (WRONG):  Source: Deploy from a branch ❌
   
   Change to (CORRECT): Source: GitHub Actions ✅
   ```

4. **Save the changes**

5. **The page will refresh** - you should see:
   - "Your site is live at https://pkwdata.github.io/M4G-BLE-Bridge/" OR
   - "Your GitHub Pages site is currently being built from the GitHub Actions workflow."

### Visual Guide:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Build and deployment                        │
│                                             │
│ Source                                      │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐   │

│ └─────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                             │
│ NOT "Deploy from a branch"                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why This Matters

- **Jekyll mode** (Deploy from branch): GitHub builds your site using Jekyll, which breaks on our React app
- **GitHub Actions mode**: Uses our custom workflow to build the Vite/React app properly

## After Changing:

1. The workflow will run automatically
2. Check: https://github.com/pkwdata/M4G-BLE-Bridge/actions
3. Look for "Deploy Device Manager to GitHub Pages" with green checkmark
4. Visit: https://pkwdata.github.io/M4G-BLE-Bridge/

## If You Don't See "GitHub Actions" Option:

This might mean:
- Repository is private (Pages requires public repo OR GitHub Pro for private)
- Actions are disabled in repository settings

**To fix**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/pkwdata/M4G-BLE-Bridge/settings/actions
2. Ensure "Actions permissions" → "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
3. Go back to Pages settings and select "GitHub Actions"

## Verification:

Once set correctly, you should see:
- ✅ No Jekyll errors
- ✅ Workflow "Deploy Device Manager to GitHub Pages" runs successfully  
- ✅ Site is live at https://pkwdata.github.io/M4G-BLE-Bridge/

---

**Status**: Waiting for you to change Pages source to "GitHub Actions"  
**Next**: The workflow will automatically run and deploy the Device Manager
