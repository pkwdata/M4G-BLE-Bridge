# Firmware Files for M4G Device Manager

This directory contains firmware binaries served by the web-based Device Manager.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The merged firmware binary is **auto-generated** when you build:

```bash
# From project root
idf.py build

# Post-build automatically creates and copies:
# â†’ M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_MERGED.bin (ready to flash at 0x0)
```

## Files

### âœ… Merged Binary (Recommended)
- **`M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_MERGED.bin`** - Complete single-file firmware
  - Contains: bootloader + partition table + app
  - Flash address: `0x0`
  - Auto-generated by `idf.py build`
  - **Use this for simplest flashing**

```json

  "name": "Display Name",
  "description": "Help text",
  "chipFamily": "ESP32S3",
  "flashSize": "4MB",
