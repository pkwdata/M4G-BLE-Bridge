# Firmware Files for M4G Device Manager

This directory contains firmware binaries served by the web-based Device Manager.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Standalone Firmware (Single Keyboard)

```bash
# From project root
idf.py build

# Post-build automatically creates and copies:
# â†’ M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_MERGED.bin (ready to flash at 0x0)
```

### Split Keyboard Firmware (Two Boards)

**Build Left Side (BLE to computer):**
```bash
./build-left.sh

# Auto-generates and copies:
# â†’ M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_LEFT_MERGED.bin
```

**Build Right Side (Wireless to left):**
```bash
./build-right.sh

# Auto-generates and copies:
# â†’ M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_RIGHT_MERGED.bin
```

## Files

### âœ… Merged Binaries (Recommended)

**Standalone Mode:**
- **`M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_MERGED.bin`** - Single keyboard firmware
  - USB to Bluetooth bridge
  - Original firmware for one keyboard
  - Flash address: `0x0`

**Split Keyboard Mode:**
- **`M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_LEFT_MERGED.bin`** - Left board firmware
  - Connects to left keyboard via USB
  - Receives from right board via 2.4GHz ESP-NOW
  - Transmits combined output via Bluetooth
  - Flash address: `0x0`

- **`M4G_BLE_BRIDGE_RIGHT_MERGED.bin`** - Right board firmware
  - Connects to right keyboard via USB
  - Transmits to left board via 2.4GHz ESP-NOW
  - No Bluetooth (acts as wireless bridge)
  - Flash address: `0x0`

### Individual Components (Advanced)
- `bootloader.bin` - Bootloader (0x0)
- `partition-table.bin` - Partition table (0x8000)
- `M4G_BLE_BRIDGE.bin` - Application (0x10000)
