# ESP32-S3 USB-to-BLE Bridge

A wireless bridge that converts USB keyboards to Bluetooth HID devices using ESP32-S3. Originally designed for the CharaChorder MasterForge keyboard, this project enables any USB keyboard to work wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

This project was originally started from ths project <https://github.com/jmdmahdi/ESP32-USB-TO-BLE>
Then with the help of Claude code I was able to modify this project to provide support to the CharaChorder Master Forge. The M4G (MasterForge) requires bridge mode support on the esp32-s3. Because of this I had to move the project from PlatformIO to IDF.

## Features

- **USB Host Support**: Full USB host functionality with hub support for complex keyboards
- **BLE HID Profile**: Complete BLE HID Over GATT Profile (HOGP) implementation
- **Windows Compatibility**: Optimized for Windows 10/11 with proper encryption and notification handling
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency keystroke forwarding with 15-byte to 8-byte HID report conversion
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatic USB device detection and BLE advertising restart
- **CharaChorder Optimized**: Specifically tuned for CharaChorder's dual ESP32-S3 internal architecture
- **Modular Components**: Clean separation of logging, LED status, USB host, BLE HID, and translation (bridge) logic
- **Persistent Boot Logs**: Captures early boot / crash logs into NVS and dumps them on next startup

## Hardware Requirements

### Primary Hardware

- **ESP32-S3 Development Board** (tested with ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1)
  - USB-OTG support required
  - Minimum 4MB flash recommended
- **USB-A Female Connector** (for keyboard connection)
- **Power Supply** (5V via USB-C or external power)

### Supported Keyboards

- **CharaChorder MasterForge** (primary target)
- Any USB HID keyboard with standard 8-byte reports
- USB hub-based keyboards (dual-half keyboards)

## Software Requirements

## Connection Setup

### Hardware Connections

```
USB Keyboard ──USB-A──> ESP32-S3 ──BLE──> Computer/Device
```

1. **Connect Keyboard**: Plug USB keyboard into ESP32-S3 USB port
2. **Power ESP32-S3**: Connect via USB-C or external 5V supply
3. **Power M4G**: Currently the M4G will require USB-C power to one of the many available USB-C ports
4. **Pair with Computer**: Look for "M4G BLE Bridge" in Bluetooth settings

### Pairing Process

1. Flash firmware and power on ESP32-S3
2. On your computer, open Bluetooth settings
3. Look for "M4G BLE Bridge" and select it
4. Complete pairing (encryption is automatic)
5. Type on your USB keyboard - keystrokes should appear on computer

## LED Status Meaning

| Color | USB Connected | BLE Connected | Meaning |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Red   | No            | No            | Idle / waiting for both sides |
| Green | Yes           | No            | USB keyboard detected; waiting for BLE peer |
| Yellow| No            | Yes           | BLE bonded/connected; waiting for keyboard |
| Blue  | Yes           | Yes           | Bridge active (typing should work) |

Implemented in the `m4g_led` component so status logic is isolated from main application code.

## Configuration

### Key Configuration Files

#### `sdkconfig.defaults`

Contains all ESP32-S3 and Bluetooth optimizations:

- USB Host configuration with hub support
- NimBLE stack configuration for Windows compatibility
- Memory and performance optimizations

#### `main/main.c`

Core application with configurable parameters:

```c
// BLE device name
#define DEVICE_NAME "M4G BLE Bridge"

// USB enumeration settings
#define CHARACHORDER_VID 0x1A40
#define CHARACHORDER_PID 0x0101
```

### Project Menu (Kconfig)

Custom project options appear under the menu title **"M4G Bridge Options"** in `menuconfig`.

Implementation details:

- The symbols are defined in the root `Kconfig.projbuild` file (standard ESP-IDF inclusion point)
- `main/Kconfig` is only a stub to avoid duplicate definitions after restructuring
- If you ever do a deep clean and the menu seems missing, press `/` in `menuconfig` and search for e.g. `M4G_ENABLE_ARROW_MOUSE` to confirm inclusion
- Run `idf.py fullclean menuconfig` if cache issues hide the menu after file moves

Logging persistence defaults: enabled on QT Py board, disabled on DevKit; toggle via `M4G_LOG_PERSISTENCE`.

### Customization

- **Device Name**: Change `DEVICE_NAME` in main.c
- **USB Vendor/Product IDs**: Modify VID/PID constants for different keyboards
- **BLE Parameters**: Adjust advertising intervals and connection parameters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. USB Device Not Detected

```
Check: USB cable connections
Check: ESP32-S3 power supply (ensure 5V)
Check: USB host configuration in sdkconfig.defaults
```

#### 2. BLE Connection Fails

```
Check: Device appears as "M4G BLE Bridge" in Bluetooth scan
Check: Clear Bluetooth cache on Windows
Check: Verify BLE compatibility mode in sdkconfig.defaults
```

#### 3. No Keystrokes Forwarded

```
Check: Monitor output shows "HID report from CharaChorder"
Check: BLE encryption completed ("Encryption enabled successfully")
Check: Notifications enabled ("force-enabled" after 3 seconds)
```

#### 4. Compilation Errors

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
idf.py fullclean
idf.py build
```

### Debug Monitoring

Enable detailed logging by monitoring serial output:

```bash
idf.py monitor
```

Look for these key indicators:

- USB enumeration: "CharaChorder hub device detected"
- BLE connection: "BLE connection established"
- Keystroke forwarding: "HID report from CharaChorder"

### Component Responsibilities

| Component      | Responsibility |
|----------------|----------------|
| `m4g_logging`  | Unified logging macro (ESP_LOG wrapper) + persistent NVS ring buffer for boot log dump |
| `m4g_led`      | Maps aggregated connection state (USB present / BLE connected) to a 4‑color status LED |
| `m4g_usb`      | USB Host stack init, device enumeration, HID interrupt IN transfer scheduling, raw report capture |
| `m4g_ble`      | BLE GAP + GATT (HID over GATT Profile), bonding, notifications for keyboard & (future) mouse reports |
| `m4g_bridge`   | Translates raw device reports into standard 8‑byte keyboard HID + optional mouse movement, de-chording / key state management |
| `main`         | Orchestration only: initialize NVS/logging, BLE, bridge, USB, LED |

### Translation (Bridge) Layer

The CharaChorder (and potentially other advanced keyboards) can emit chorded or extended reports. The `m4g_bridge` component:

1. Receives raw HID packets from `m4g_usb`
2. Maintains an active key set / chord state
3. Flattens chords into a standard boot keyboard report (modifier + 6 key slots)
4. Optionally converts directional key groups (e.g. arrow keys) into relative mouse deltas (enabling rudimentary mouse-emulation) and forwards via `m4g_ble`
5. Caches last sent keyboard & mouse reports to suppress redundant notifications

This keeps USB acquisition and BLE transport unaware of device‑specific translation rules.

### Persistent Logging

Early boot and intermittent issues are captured using a lightweight append-only log stored in NVS. On each boot:

1. Stored log entries (previous session) are dumped to the console
2. The buffer is cleared
3. New entries accumulate during runtime (size bounded)

Enable / disable category logging with compile-time flags (e.g. `ENABLE_DEBUG_USB`, `ENABLE_DEBUG_BLE`) defined in the logging header. All components use the same `LOG_AND_SAVE(level, tag, fmt, ...)` macro so critical events are preserved even if a crash occurs before they reach the monitor.

### Runtime Sequence

1. NVS + logging system initialize and prior boot logs are emitted
2. BLE stack starts and advertises HID service
3. Bridge initializes internal key state
4. USB host starts and begins enumerating devices / scheduling HID IN transfers
5. As soon as raw reports arrive they are translated and sent over BLE notifications (once a BLE client connects & enables notifications or auto-force logic engages)
6. LED component updates color whenever USB device presence or BLE connection state changes

### Why This Modularity Matters

- Easier future swaps (e.g. replace BLE HID with 2.4GHz link) without touching USB layer
- Simplified debugging: isolate whether a problem is acquisition (usb), translation (bridge), or transport (ble)
- Unit / integration test hooks: each component can add self-test functions invoked during init

### Future Extension Points

- Multi-keyboard merge (aggregate multiple USB endpoints) inside `m4g_bridge`
- Advanced macro / text expansion dictionary before emitting BLE reports
- Dynamic configuration service (BLE characteristic or simple RPC) to toggle translation behaviors at runtime

### Previous Simplification Note

Earlier revisions performed conversion directly in `main.c` / USB callback. Those responsibilities were intentionally migrated into `m4g_bridge` to eliminate code duplication and to keep `m4g_usb` a pure acquisition layer.
